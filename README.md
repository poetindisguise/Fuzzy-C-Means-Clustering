# Fuzzy-C-Means-Clustering
* Implemented Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm for 56 datasets, from scratch.
* Found the optimal value of clusters for each dataset using Silhouette Coefficient and Daviesâ€“Bouldin index.
* The python code implementing the clustering algorithm can be found in FuzzyCMeans.py.
* A csv file containing Silhouette Coeff and DB Index values for each clustering will be formed.
